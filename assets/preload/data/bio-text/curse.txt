Curse
Curse is described as a little ball of sunshine who just needs a break from the world.
He has a heart of gold and wants nothing more
but to see those around him happy and chipper.
While still dealing with his own inner demons,
he still makes time for those around himand makes sure they're happy.
Despite this, he's still a bit stubborn when it comes to his own wellbeing,
he doesn't like being worried for, he loathes it due to hyper independence.
